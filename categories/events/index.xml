      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s ApacheCon was an overwhelming success, with many tracks running in parallel. If you missed some of the talks on the Camel/Integration or would like to revisit your favorites, video recordings from ApacheCon @Home 2020 are now available on The Apache Software Foundation YouTube channel.
You can watch the content from all three days in one playlist, with over 10 hours of content.
For convenience, we listed the talks as they appear in the schedule here along with the slides shared by the speakers.</description>
